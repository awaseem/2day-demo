# 2day Demo Site

## Getting Started

You'll need to ensure that you have a version of the [2day-api](https://github.com/awaseem/2day-api) running locally or hosted somewhere. Ensure you have an active account ID and API key, you can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/awaseem/2day-api). For the demo, the source IDs are hard coded based on hosted version of the 2day-api I have deployed.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
